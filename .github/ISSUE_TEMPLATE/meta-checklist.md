The following checklists will guide you through the process of advancing a recipe through its pipeline. You can click on "Submit new issue" now, and read on later.

For issue meta-management, please conduct the following steps:

- [ ] change the title of this issue to a title that gives sufficient detail about the recipe you want to bring into the cookbook
- [ ] assign this issue also to yourself (at your right side: click "Assignees" -> search for your username here on Github -> click it)

Now you can delete the text above.
If you needed to add a task to the list below, please think about amending the issue template: https://github.com/FAIRplus/the-fair-cookbook/blob/migrating/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/meta-checklist.md
